This is also known as Ursa Major and Big Dipper. It resembles the shape of a ladle. 
The four stars which appear as four vertices of a quadrilateral 
make the bowl of the ladle and the remaining three stars make the handle of the ladle. 
Ursa Major appears in the northern sky. The pole star is in line with last two stars of the quadrilateral. 
Since this constellation appears quite close to the pole star, it looks as if revolving around the pole star.
