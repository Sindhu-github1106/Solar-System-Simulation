The planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars, are called terrestrial because they have a compact, rocky 
surface like Earth's terra firma. The terrestrial planets are the four innermost planets in the solar 
system. None of the terrestrial planets have rings, although Earth does have belts of trapped radiation. 
Among the terrestrials, only Earth has a substantial planetary magnetic field. Mars and the Earth's 
moon have localized regional magnetic fields at different places across their surfaces, but no global field.

Of the terrestrial planets, Venus, Earth, and Mars have significant atmospheres. The gases present in 
a planetary atmosphere are related to a planet's size, mass, temperature, how the planet was formed, 
and whether life is present.
