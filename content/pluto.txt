When Pluto was discovered in 1930, it was called the ninth planet in our solar system, but its status as a fully 
fledged planet came into question in the 1990s. Pluto was officially reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006. 

The best-known dwarf planet, Pluto is also the largest in size and the second largest in mass. Pluto has five moons. 
The largest, Charon, is over half the size of its host. Pluto's orbit is not circular like those of the other 
planets and it actually crosses Neptune's orbit, which means that Pluto is sometimes closer to the Sun than Neptune 
is. It takes Pluto nearly 250 years to complete one trip around the Sun. 

Not much was known about Pluto before NASA's New Horizons mission. Launched in 2006, the spacecraft took nearly 
nine years to reach its target. The mission revealed that Pluto's surface features plains and mountains made of 
nitrogen ice and water ice.
