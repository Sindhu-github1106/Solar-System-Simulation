Ceres is the largest object in the asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. This dwarf planet alone 
contains about a third of all the matter found in the belt! Its near-spherical shape means that this rocky, icy 
body is not considered an asteroid. While most dwarf planets orbit the Sun at the very outer edges of our solar 
system, Ceres is the only one located inside the orbit of Neptune. It takes Ceres 4.6 years to complete one trip 
around the Sun. Scientists suspect that this unique dwarf planet may even have an ocean of liquid water hidden 
under a layer of ice. 

NASA's Dawn spacecraft was launched in 2007 and entered into orbit around Ceres after first observing nearby 
asteroid Vesta. Dawn allowed astronomers to see detailed images of the dwarf planet for the first time and find 
out more about its composition and surface.
