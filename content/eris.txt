Located beyond the orbit of Neptune, Eris completes one trip around the Sun every 557 years. 
It is slightly smaller than Pluto but actually contains over 25% more matter. 
The discovery of this denser dwarf planet in 2005 may have been the turning point that forced 
astronomers to reconsider Pluto's classification as a planet. To illustrate this disruption, 
Eris was named after the Greek goddess of discord. Since Eris is so far away, 
no surface details can be seen with current instruments, but astronomers have detected 
the presence of methane ice and believe Eris's surface is similar to that of Pluto.
