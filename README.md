# Solar System Simulation

This project is a Python-based Solar System Simulation built using the Tkinter library and Ursina engine. The simulation allows users to explore different celestial objects such as dwarf planets, planets, moons, and constellations through an interactive graphical interface and dynamic 3D models.

## Features

- **Dwarf Planets**: View details about dwarf planets in the solar system.
- **Planets**: Explore planets and their characteristics.
- **Moons**: Learn about moons orbiting different planets.
- **Constellations**: Discover constellations like Ursa Major, Leo, and Orion.
- **3D Solar System Simulation**: A dynamic 3D simulation of planets orbiting the sun using the Ursina engine.

## How to Run

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your machine.
- Install the **Ursina** library for the 3D solar system simulation:
   ```bash
   pip install ursina
